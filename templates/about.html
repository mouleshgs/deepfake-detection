        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Deepfake Image Detector. This application uses a machine learning model to detect if an image is real or deepfake.</p>
        <p>The model is based on the VGG16 architecture, fine-tuned for binary classification of images. It leverages deep learning techniques and image preprocessing to determine whether an image is manipulated.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to help identify and combat the spread of deepfake content in social media and other platforms.</p>
